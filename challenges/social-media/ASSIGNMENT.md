# Coding Challenge - Social media connections

You are tasked with making Grookr, a new social media product by Grover Everything S/A. The initial step is to create a prototype service that provides a REST API where we can simulate connections between people, and explore how we would offer new connection suggestions.

## These are the features required:

- Be able to add a new profile;
- Be able to tag two profiles as connected;
- Be able to generate a list of new connection suggestions for a certain profile, taking the stance that the more connections a profile has with another profile's connections, the better ranked the suggestion should be;
- Some profiles can, for privacy reasons, opt to be hidden from the connection suggestions.

## General notes:

- This challenge will be extended by you and a Grover engineer on a different step of the process;
- Please make sure to anonymize your submission by removing your name from file headers and such;
- Feel free to expand your design in writing;
- You will submit the source code for your solution to us as a compressed file containing all the code and possible documentation. Please make sure to not include unnecessary files such as the Git repository, compiled binaries, etc;
- Please do not upload your solution to public repositories in GitHub, BitBucket, etc.

## Things we are looking for:

- Immutability/Referential transparency;
- Idiomatic code;
- Adherence to community/standard library style guides;
- Separation of concerns;
- Unit and integration tests;
- API design;
- Domain modeling;
- Attention to possible concurrency issues;
- Error handling
