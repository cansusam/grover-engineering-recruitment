# Coding Challenge - Social media connections

You are tasked with making Grookr, a new social media product by Grover Everything S/A. The initial step is to create a prototype service that provides a REST API where we can simulate connections between people, and explore how we would offer new connection suggestions.

## These are the features required:

- Be able to add a new profile;
- Be able to tag two profiles as connected;
- Be able to generate a list of new connection suggestions for a certain profile, taking the stance that the more connections a profile has with another profile's connections, the better ranked the suggestion should be;
- Some profiles can, for privacy reasons, opt to be hidden from the connection suggestions.

## Things we are looking for:

- Immutability/Referential transparency;
- Idiomatic code;
- Adherence to community/standard library style guides;
- Separation of concerns;
- Unit and integration tests;
- API design;
- Domain modeling;
- Attention to possible concurrency issues;
- Error handling
